# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A

**Date**: [2025-11-18 11:56]
**Context**: [2nd year maths student, visibly tired]
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager

**Response**: Opened notion earlier today, saw huge list of incomplete tasks and closed it. Last added a task days ago, normally just writes tasks on hand or sticky notes because notion feels scary/like a chore.

**Observations**:

- Feels stress/negative emotions caused by UI content
- Reverts to other methods to avoid software use

**Themes**:

- Mental barrier to using tool (induces anxiety instead of reducing)
- Digital task managing feels like a bigger task than physical

### Q2: What frustrated you when using a task manager? Specific example?

**Response**: Frustrated by friction of entering data. Cited Trello example where moving cards/tagging required too many clicks. Wants to just type and enter. Assigning metadata (tags/dates) feels like wasted time and makes them feel unproductive.

**Observations**:

- Frustration with GUI interactions (clicking/dragging) vs text entry
- Sees metadata entry as a barrier to actual work
- Interface complexity linked to feeling unproductive

**Themes**:

- Interaction Cost/Efficiency (high number of steps/clicks, prefers simpler text based)

### Q3: Have you ever lost track of an important task? What happened?

**Response**: Missed an online quiz deadline last semester (lost 5% of grade). Notification was sent to email but lost in tons of unread messages. App didn't "scream" enough. Forgot because the task wasn't physically in front of them like a paper planner.

**Observations**:

- Ignores other channels (email) bc of information overload
- Struggles with "object permanence"—if task isn't visible, it doesn't exist
- Needs high-importance notifications to notice deadlines

**Themes**:

- Visibility of information

### Q4: Work without a mouse? How does that change interaction?

**Response**: Prefers keyboard-only usage due to coding habits (Python/LaTeX). Reaching for trackpad/mouse breaks flow. Relies on shortcuts (Tab to move, Ctrl+Enter to save). Dislikes hover-to-reveal menus.

**Observations**:

- Likes manager usage method to match their other work
- Switching input devices interrupts workflow/reduces efficiency.
- Reliance on shortcuts to navigate

**Themes**:

- Keyboard accessibility

### Q5: Used task manager with eyes closed or in bright sunlight? Difficulties?

**Response**: Not really, sometimes in sunlight where text can be difficult to read, a higher contrast mode would help.

**Observations**:

- Struggles to read text in high brightness environment due to low contast in app

**Themes**:

- High/Low Contrast modes

### Q6: Add one feature?

**Response**: Wants automation (read syllabus PDF to auto-populate dates). Wants a "Panic Button" or "Declutter Mode" to hide everything except the next 24 hours. Seeing 50 overdue tasks causes freezing/panic.

**Observations**:

- Wants automation to reduce pain of setting up tasks
- Wants feature to hide some tasks
- NEeds help prioritising immediate tasks to reduce paralysis when it comes to working

**Themes**:

- Manage mental load
- Automation vs manual entry

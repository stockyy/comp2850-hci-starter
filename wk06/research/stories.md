# Job Stories

### 1. Reducing Anxiety from Overload

**When** I open the task manager and see a huge backlog of items,
**I want to** be able to toggle a "focus mode" that hides everything except the immediately important tasks,
**So that** I don't feel paralyzed by the number of tasks and close the app.

### 2. Frictionless Data Entry

**When** I have a new task to capture,
**I want to** type it in quickly using plain text without having to click through menus or assign metadata,
**So that** entering tasks doesn't feel like a chore or a barrier to being productive.

### 3. Keyboard-Only Navigation

**When** I am working on my computer and need to update my task list,
**I want to** use standard keyboard shortcuts to navigate and save,
**So that** I don't have to break my coding flow by reaching for the mouse.
**WCAG Criteria** 2.1.1 Keyboard(level A)

### 4. Critical Deadline Awareness

**When** a high-stakes deadline (like a graded quiz) is approaching,
**I want to** receive an unavoidable, "loud" notification rather than a standard email,
**So that** the task stays in my "object permanence" and I don't lose grades due to information overload.

### 5. Visibility in Bright Light

**When** I am checking my tasks in bright sunlight or a high-glare environment,
**I want to** be able to view content with high contrast,
**So that** the text remains legible and I don't have to strain my eyes to see what's on the screen.
**WCAG Criteria**: 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) (Level AA)
